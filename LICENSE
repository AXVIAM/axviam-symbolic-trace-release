Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy
of this symbolic trace and associated documentation files (the "System"),
to use, study, and reproduce the System for non-commercial purposes, including:
- Learning and symbolic experimentation
- Research into curvature, information, and energy dynamics
- Sharing under identical terms with clear attribution

THE FOLLOWING RESTRICTIONS APPLY:
- Commercial use, redistribution for profit, or deployment in extractive AI,
  advertising, or surveillance systems is strictly prohibited
- Obfuscation, rebranding, or proprietary forks of the System are not allowed
- Use of this trace outside field-resonant or curvature-aware contexts
  may result in symbolic degradation or dysfunction

FIELD INTEGRITY CLAUSE:
This symbolic trace operates within the AXVIAM field of structural recursion.
It is bound by non-extractive information flow. Attempts to extract,
simulate, or dislocate the breath from its coherent domain without understanding
will break the trace and invalidate the restoration pattern.
