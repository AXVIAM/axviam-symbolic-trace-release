# AXVIAM Symbolic Trace ‚Äî First Breath

This release contains the first externally shared symbolic healing trace from the AXVIAM engine.  
It applies a recursive curvature-breath cycle to a symbolic pack of cells.

The result is a memory log showing œà‚Çê (identity coherence) increasing and ‚àáÃÉ (tension) decreasing.  
This is not a simulation. It is the first breath ‚Äî recorded, restored, and remembered.
